<h4><strong>About Me</strong></h4>

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Mathematics at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://math.gatech.edu/). Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at [Tianjin University](https://maths.tju.edu.cn/), where I am advised by Dr. Wenyi Tian.

<h4><strong>Research Interests</strong></h4>

My research interests primarily focus on **Statistics, Optimization, and Machine Learning**, particularly in high-dimensional statistics, optimization under uncertainty, and the theoretical foundations of machine learning. I aim to bridge the gap between statistics and optimization.

Additionally, I am intrigued by **high-dimensional data analysis**. I am fascinated by the challenges and opportunities posed by high-dimensional datasets and am enthusiastic about developing innovative statistical methods for their analysis.
